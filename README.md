I would **highly** recommend against using this repo as it is extremely out of date as well as being my first React and Typescript project having never worked with JavaScript the code isn't great. Once the module federation system comes out I will be rewriting these apps so they can be used as drag and drop resources.

This repo contains my fork of NPWD with QBCore supported apps and emojis in messages.

Apps:
Garage
Housing
Mail

I have no clue if housing is working on this repo as I can't seem to find my files and can't remember what I ended up pushing

Ignore the commit names as I was just using GIT to transfer the files between my laptop and PC and had no intention of making this repo public
