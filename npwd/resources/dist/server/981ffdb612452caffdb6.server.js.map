Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar _require$codes = require('../errors').codes,\n    ERR_METHOD_NOT_IMPLEMENTED = _require$codes.ERR_METHOD_NOT_IMPLEMENTED,\n    ERR_MULTIPLE_CALLBACK = _require$codes.ERR_MULTIPLE_CALLBACK,\n    ERR_TRANSFORM_ALREADY_TRANSFORMING = _require$codes.ERR_TRANSFORM_ALREADY_TRANSFORMING,\n    ERR_TRANSFORM_WITH_LENGTH_0 = _require$codes.ERR_TRANSFORM_WITH_LENGTH_0;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\nrequire('inherits')(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction afterTransform(er, data) {\n  var ts = this._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (cb === null) {\n    return this.emit('error', new ERR_MULTIPLE_CALLBACK());\n  }\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n  if (data != null) // single equals check for both `null` and `undefined`\n    this.push(data);\n  cb(er);\n  var rs = this._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    this._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n  this._transformState = {\n    afterTransform: afterTransform.bind(this),\n    needTransform: false,\n    transforming: false,\n    writecb: null,\n    writechunk: null,\n    writeencoding: null\n  }; // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true; // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  } // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n\n\n  this.on('prefinish', prefinish);\n}\n\nfunction prefinish() {\n  var _this = this;\n\n  if (typeof this._flush === 'function' && !this._readableState.destroyed) {\n    this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(_this, er, data);\n    });\n  } else {\n    done(this, null, null);\n  }\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n}; // This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.
